# P5 Garden Project

My garden animation project written in p5.js




# How to use

To place a flower, click where you want the base of the flower to be. (mouse position only affects the X axis)
If you want to set the colour of the flower, use the colour picker at the bottom and then place the flower.
*Note: currently the colour of a flower cannot be changed once it is placed*
